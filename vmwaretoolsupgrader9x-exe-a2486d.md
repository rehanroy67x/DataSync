VMwareToolsUpgrader9x.exe is an executable file associated with VMware Workstation Player, specifically linked to version 7.7.0.1450, and is published by VMware. This file is designed to facilitate the upgrading of VMware Tools on virtual machines running on older Windows systems, particularly those from the 9x series. Generally considered safe, this executable is a legitimate component of VMware's virtualization software; however, as with any executable, there is a potential risk of malware if the file is downloaded from untrustworthy sources or if the system is infected.
