VBoxHeadless.exe is an executable file associated with VirtualBox, a popular open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle Corporation, specifically version 6.0.14. This file is designed to run virtual machines in a headless mode, meaning it operates without a graphical user interface, allowing users to manage virtual machines remotely or on servers without the need for a desktop environment. Generally, VBoxHeadless.exe is considered safe when downloaded from the official VirtualBox website, as it is a legitimate component of the software; however, like any executable file, it can be targeted by malware, so users should ensure their antivirus software is up to date and scan for any unusual behavior or errors. Common issues that may arise with VBoxHeadless.exe include problems with virtual machine startup, configuration errors, or compatibility issues with host operating systems, often requiring troubleshooting or updates to resolve.
